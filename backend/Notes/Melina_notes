1. Add the option for the user to select which documents to chunk and how to chunk.

2. Add documents' version to pinecone

3. document processor and master problem with api calling, very slow (agent)
Answer:
--------------------------
During summarization, each chunk gets its own POST /chat/completions call.

With 15 chunks and 4 workers, you’ll likely hit 4 requests at once repeatedly until all are done.

Your retry logic may compound this (e.g. 4 retrying + 4 new ones).

Your embedding step is batched, so it doesn’t contribute to request spikes.
